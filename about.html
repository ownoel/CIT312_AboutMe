      <h3>Why am I taking this class?</h3>
      <p>Besides the obvious statement that CIT 312 is a required class, I have other reasons why I am taking it.
        First, I actually find web development to be fun even though it can be frustrating. More importantly,
        I want to pursue a career in web development as that is what I have learned the most
         in college. While I still have A LOT to learn and more practice to do, I feel confident in my abilities.</p>
      <h3>What do I hope to achieve?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A passing grade.</li>
        <li>Gain more knowledge of web development.</li>
        <li>Enhance my web development skills.</li>
      </ul>
